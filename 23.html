<p class="info">I believe that my website is stylistically gorgeous. I have carefully selected a colour scheme my considering my own interests and opting for a bright yet mellow, hip-hopesque and almost childlike colour-scheme. Following on from this I’ve kept the general website minimalistic to stick with a modern feel. I want the end user to only focus on the website and not be distracted by an overload of irrelevant information, or a pointlessly high number of pictures. My website only shows users the information they need to see. The one thing I’d change if I’d had more time I would have created separate CSS stylesheets for each page, I didn’t as I knew how I wanted the website to feel and I feel as though even by aiming for the minimum in this regard I’ve still achieved what I wanted.</p>
