<p class="info">IT can make you generally more productive through the use of specialised productivity tools. I’ve talked about it a lot but when building my website Trello has been incredibly helpful and would have been if worked in a team. The one downside with IT tools/systems is sometimes they think a bit too laterally, sometimes they feel as if they’re innovating for the sake of it, instead of creating a solution we actually need. If I’d done this in a team I would have had somebody creating the stylesheet for the website, which they keep up to date and shared around, the other team members would have worked together to add the actual information and elements into the website.
