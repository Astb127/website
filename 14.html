<p class="info">I personally believe that the biggest risk in a digital project is scope. You need to understand your own limitations. If you go into a project with unrealistically large ambitions you could likely become swamped by the relatively high amount of work you need to complete. You need to know what a realistic goal for an amount to complete is in the available time frame, as well as knowing your own skillset so you don’t attempt to do to stuff that’ll put you off working on your project. An unrealistic scope will lead to you failing to adequately finish your project in time.</p>
