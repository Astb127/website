<p class="info">The first thing you need to be able to do is know what the purpose of your IT system and/or software is. If I was for example considering building a website I’d first consider whether to use a Desktop or Laptop, I’d opt for a laptop as then you can work on the go. Then I’d consider what operating system to use. I personally would opt for Windows as I’m more comfortable using it.
Following this I’d look into what software would be best to achieve my goal. I would use Notepad++ as I have previous experience with it. 
The way you make sure you’ve selected the right technology is by doing a lot of research and also using what you know.
