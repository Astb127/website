<p class="info">
        I believe that my website is fit for purpose, the brief asked for a website that has an About Me section as well as having the Units cleanly collected in a way thatâ€™s easy to read. I believe that I have adequately met the brief requirements based on how carefully I have studied them whilst working. I have also kept my Trello Board up to date and accurate as my project has progressed.
