<p class="info">If I were to build a website again and had a longer period of time to work on it I’d first start by creating a mood board and storyboarding the website in Photoshop. My workflow works better when I know what I want the end product to look like. This would have added more time to the beginning of the project but would have allowed me to create the actual website quicker as I’d have a better vision of the end product in my head.</p>
