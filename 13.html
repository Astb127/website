<p class="info">As previously mentioned Trello is an incredibly useful tool to help you work out exactly what you need to work on, this allows you to prioritise your work properly as you can set your work into sections for: What needs doing, what are we doing, and what we’ve done. So if we were going to build a personal website I’d consider the following plan: 
        I’d start by planning out what pages I need: Home, Units, About Me and Extras.
        Then I’d consider the overall design of the website. I’d break this down into sections to add to a Trello. For example: Colour Scheme, Layout and menu system.
        I would then proceed to work on the project and remember to move tasks from To Do, to doing and then to Done. I would also add new tasks to my Trello as I went along
