<p class="info">When creating a project it’s important you have clear goals for yourself and your team to reach. A good idea is to assign a project manager, somebody who can take the responsibility of making sure everybody is on target and knows the goals they’re trying to reach. A good tool to help you understand your goals, how well you’re doing is Trello. Trello allows you to create a Kanban board from which you can add and see what tasks you need to complete, are working on and have completed (as well as other sections you might need). This allows you to keep the task feeling achievable and understand exactly what needs to be done without going off topic or feeling as if there’s an unachievable weight on your shoulders. Another tool worth using is the previously mentioned Slack, this would allow us to discuss the progress we’ve made and easily discuss progress with our teammates. I believe that the most important skill in building a project is teamwork as this will allow you to work with your teammates to achieve your end goal.</p>
