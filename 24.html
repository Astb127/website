<p class="info">If I were to continue working on the website I would make sure everything is centered better than they currently are. Currently things are on some particular pages a little bit off. I would also consider doing more with the background as the fixed pink can get a bit boring. I would likely try to add more information about myself to the About Me section to give it a more biographic feel.</p>
