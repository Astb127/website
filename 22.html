<p class="info">I believe that Visual Studio was appropriate, it has allowed me to create a website Iâ€™m very happy with in a relatively short period of time. The general workflow and functionality has suited me perfectly. On top of this Trello has allowed me to organise my workflow, for a larger project this is ideal, as it restrains you from going to far on one area of the website whilst neglecting another.</p>
