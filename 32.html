<p class="info">The first method I’d recommend is to take regular breaks, if you keep working non-stop you’ll see a decline in your personal performance the longer you work without a break as you will overwork yourself. It’s important that you keep your mind fresh. You should try to focus on one task at a time and not multitask. Multitasking leads to you not concentrating as much on each task, as well as this you should give up on trying to make things perfect, you should instead aim to make things as good as reasonably possible whilst knowing your deadline whether that’s imposed by your employer/client or yourself.
