<p class="info">IT is used in Modern Business for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons IT is used in modern business to improve productivity. Using a computer allows you to use productivity tools such as Excel. Excel helps you create spreadsheets, if you were to create a spreadsheet without a computer youâ€™d have to use a calculator or manually work out equations that in Excel you can calculate quickly. This is a basic example of the way IT has modernised businesses. Another advantage is that you can communicate with coworkers and customers easier and more efficiently. When it comes to communicating with colleagues you can either send and receive emails with relevant information or you could use a communication tool such as Slack to achieve the same as emails but with the advantage of the messages being sent and received in real time. Another option would be to use Google Hangouts to have voice or video conversation with colleagues and prospective customers no matter where in the world they are.When it comes to Customer Service we can use similar technologies to as for colleagues. We can also use email for professional communication. We can also use real time messaging services to allow people to contact us and talk with a member of staff at any time.</p>
