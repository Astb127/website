<p class="info">Trello has allowed me to keep my workflow organised. This has allowed me to concentrate my energy on achieving the goals systematically instead of worrying about the overall project. It’s fragmented the workload into easily achievable sections. 
Github allows us to use version control to keep a constantly updating backup of our project and restore it back to a previous version if a mistake has been made. You can easily see any and all changes that you’ve made as you go along, this means you don’t have to stress if things go wrong.
