<p class="info">In our example of building a website I would take advantage of Web Testing to get a good idea of how a website flows. By getting a user to use the website and navigate themselves around it and judge the readability etc, we can find out if the website works as it should from somebody elses perspective, as the creator of the site we tend to be bias towards it as we fully understand it how itâ€™s meant to work.</p>
