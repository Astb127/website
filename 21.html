<p class="info">When making my website I exclusively used VSCode and Trello. I used VSCode to actually code the website. VSCode much like Notepad++ allows you (the user) to see different colours for different parts of the code, as well as keeping the code nicely ordered. The general workflow of VSCode has a good feel to it. It feels smooth and easy to use. I am very happy to have used VSCode for my project.
        Trello has allowed me to stay productive throughout the project, I have been able to breakdown my thoughts into a clear and concise flow in order to get my work done quickly and efficiently.</p>
